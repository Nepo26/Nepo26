So Hey, I'm Henrique, currently a Back-End engineer working primarily with NodeJs with typescript.
I'm studying computer engineer at Goias' Federal University ( UFG ).

I'm currently working on a serverless backend using cdk to deploy on AWS. Using lambdas and other features from AWS.

I almost always tend to look on security related issues, works and my main objective is to work exclusively on this field.

I don't necessarily have a favorite language as I dabled with some languages on the past. My main language right now is _NodeJS_. I have some experience with _Java_, _C_, _python_, _bash_. And had used denizen which is a scripting language of minecraft.

Hmmm...I think that generally that is it. If you want some help with anything or want to contact me my info is right above.
