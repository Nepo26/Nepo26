Hey, I'm Henrique Nepomuceno, currently working as a Software Enginner at DevIT. Working with multiple projects inside there, really depends on the clients need.

On my free time I'm working towards my [OSCP Certification](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/).

I'm studying computer engineering at Goias' Federal University ( UFG ).

I have a project that is curently in development called [UrutauSec](urutausec.com.br), which is a side project to iniciate students on the security side of things and instigate them to contribute to the community. **\*Currently Work In Progress\***

I work mainly with _Java_, with the Spring framework, be it _Spring Boot_, _Spring Integration_, _Spring Security_ or any other. The other languages that I had worked with are _NodeJS_, _C_, _python_, _javascript_, _typescript_ and _bash_.

If you want some help with anything or want to say hi just send me a message on [telegram](https://t.me/Nepo26) or reach me out on my [email](mailto:nepo26.hn@gmail.com).
