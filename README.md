Hey, I'm Henrique, currently working towards my [OSCP Certification](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/).
I'm studying computer engineering at Goias' Federal University ( UFG ).

I have a project that is curently in development called [UrutauSec](urutausec.com.br), which is a side project to iniciate students on the security side of things and instigate thaem to contribute. **\*Currently Work In Progress\***

I don't necessarily have a favorite programming language as I dabbled with quite a lot of languages on the past. My main language right now is _NodeJS_. The ones that I had worked more are _Java_, _C_, _python_, _javascript_ and _bash_.

If you want some help with anything or want to say hi just send me a message on [telegram](https://t.me/Nepo26) or reach me out on my [email](mailto:nepo26.hn@gmail.com).
