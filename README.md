Hey, I'm Henrique Nepomuceno, currently working as a Devops Analyst at ZGSoluções. Helping the Infraestructure/Devops team to provide better assistance for our developers, and helping to sustain our applications up.

On my free time I'm working towards my [OSCP Certification](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/).

I have a project that is curently in development called [UrutauSec](urutausec.com.br), which is a side project to iniciate students on the security side of things and instigate them to contribute to the community. **\*Currently Work In Progress\***

I work mainly with _Java_, with the Spring framework, be it _Spring Boot_, _Spring Integration_, _Spring Security_ or any other. The other languages that I had worked with are _NodeJS_, _C_, _python_, _javascript_, _typescript_ and _bash_.

I'm starting to study the GO language so I can provide better help on some open source projects.

If you want some help with anything or want to say hi just send me a message on [telegram](https://t.me/Nepo26) or reach me out on my [email](mailto:nepo26.hn@gmail.com).
